Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

This is a tool image to help install DRBD kernel modules and DRBD utils.

For now, it supports the following OS distros: 

    RHEL/CentOS 7
    RHEL/CentOS 8
    Ubuntu 18 Bionic
    Ubuntu 20 Focal
    Ubuntu 22 Jammy

OS distros are by default auto-detected as "distroAutoDetect: true" is set in values.yaml

If you want to manually specify OS distros, set "distroAutoDetect: false" and add to "distros: []" in values.yaml
